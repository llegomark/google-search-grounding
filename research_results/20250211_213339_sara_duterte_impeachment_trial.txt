can senate start impeachment trial during break?

[2025-02-11 01:32:31 PM UTC] Assistant:
---------------------------------------
Conflicting views exist regarding whether the Senate can start an impeachment trial during a break:

*   **Yes, it can:** Some argue that the Senate is not barred from starting the impeachment trial during a congressional recess. They cite constitutional mandates that the trial should "forthwith proceed" once the articles of impeachment are transmitted to the Senate, regardless of whether Congress is in session or on break. Some legal experts say the Senate should begin preparations and start the trial even before June.
*   **No, it cannot:** Senate President Chiz Escudero has stated that the Senate will not hold the impeachment trial during the session break, arguing that the impeachment court can only be convened in a plenary session. He clarified that while the trial could proceed during a recess, it must be started, convened, and the judges sworn in while the Senate is in session.

what happens when sara duterte is impeached by the senate?

[2025-02-11 01:32:58 PM UTC] Assistant:
---------------------------------------
If Sara Duterte is impeached by the Senate, meaning she is convicted on the charges against her, the following would occur:

*   **Removal from Office:** She would be removed from her position as Vice President of the Philippines (The Diplomat, OCCRP).
*   **Disqualification:** She would be disqualified from holding any public office in the future (The Diplomat).
*   **Succession:** The constitutional rules of succession would apply to determine who would take over as Vice President.
*   **Economic Impact:** President Marcos has stated that the impeachment would not have an adverse impact on the Philippine economy (PCO). However, analysts suggest there could be immediate effects on the capital market and banking sector (Daily Tribune).

---------------------------------------
If Sara Duterte resigns from her position as Vice President of the Philippines, the following would occur:

*   **Vacancy in the Vice Presidency:** Her resignation would create a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. (Official Gazette)
*   **Succession:** According to the Constitution, if the Vice President resigns, the President appoints a new Vice President from among the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The appointment takes effect upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of the Congress, voting separately. (Official Gazette, Chan Robles Virtual Law Library)
*   **No Impeachment Trial:** The impeachment trial in the Senate would likely be moot, as she would no longer hold the office for which she was being impeached.
*   **Political Repercussions:** Her resignation would likely have significant political repercussions, potentially impacting the stability of the current administration and the political landscape of the Philippines.
